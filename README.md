Comprehensive analysis of AtliQ Mart's promotional strategies during Diwali 2023 &amp; Sankranti 2024. This repository contains datasets, SQL queries, and visual insights highlighting the effectiveness of various promotions on sales volumes and revenue across different product categories and stores.


Problem Description üßê:
AtliQ Mart, a retail leader with a significant presence in Southern India, grappled with evaluating the impact of their festive promotions on sales across their range of stores and product categories. The critical period under review included Diwali 2023 and Sankranti 2024, times of high consumer activity.

Requirement & Analysis üîé:
Peter Pandey, tasked with this analytical challenge, pored over vast datasets to deduce the performance metrics. The focus was on Incremental Sold Units (ISU) and Incremental Revenue (IR) from varied promotional strategies implemented across different product categories and stores.

Insights Review üìà:

Top Performers: Combo deals and essential goods like Grocery & Staples soared in sales, with Cashback offers bringing in hefty revenues.

Mixed Results: Home Appliances and Home Care products showed a preference for the BOGOF strategy, highlighting its effectiveness in non-daily use categories.

Underperformers: Personal Care items didn‚Äôt demonstrate a significant difference in sales regardless of the promotion, indicating potential market saturation or ineffective promotional messaging.

Promotion Effectiveness: Cashback offers, despite their lower ISU, achieved the highest IR, suggesting that while they attracted fewer purchases, the purchases made were of higher value. Discount promotions had mixed success; deeper discounts did not always correlate with increased revenue or sold units.

Solution for Future üöÄ:
Armed with these insights, AtliQ Mart is positioned to refine its promotional tactics:

Strategic Discounting: Pivot towards moderate discounting and lucrative cashback offers to enhance margins.

Tailored Promotions: Customize promotions for product categories based on proven effectiveness‚Äîmore substantial discounts for high-value items and bundle deals for essentials.

Consumer Behavior Insights: Further research into customer buying patterns could refine promotion strategies, especially in underperforming categories.

Optimized Inventory Management: Align stock levels with promotional strategies to avoid overstocking or stockouts, maximizing sales potential.
